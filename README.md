## About The app 
This is a study app made for anyone who would like to study programming languages.
The app uses Cloud Firestore and Firebase auth to save user information. The app functions include:

## Quiz
This app includes quizzes on programming languages Python, javascript, java, C++, and Linux.
The quiz feature reads JSON files within the app and outputs a quiz that includes a 30-second timer to complete each of 10 questions. Upon completion, the user is sent to the results page that displays the statistics of the user's quiz.

# Notes
The notes feature allows users to create notes in their app by clicking on the add note button and creating a note page with a title, automated time and date, and a content area. The user can save their notes, and on the main note page, a small card will display a preview of each saved note. The note pages are also saved in Cloud Firestore.

# Book Search:
For users who would like more resources on the topics they are studying, this app uses the Google Books API to load books based on the user's search. Users can input a book title or topic, and the API returns books titles, authors, and descriptions related to that topic. The user can favorite the books that they find interesting.
